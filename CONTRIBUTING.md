# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in Redpill Gateway! To keep collaboration smooth, please follow these basics:

1. **Discuss first**: For new features or large changes, open an issue to align on goals and approach.
2. **Use topic branches**: Create branches like `feature/<topic>` or `fix/<topic>` instead of working on the main branch.
3. **Make focused commits**: Each commit should cover a single logical change with a clear message for easy review and rollback.
4. **Add tests**: When adding or changing logic, include or update tests for the main scenarios and ensure `npm test` passes locally.
5. **Run linters/formatters**: Use the provided scripts (e.g., `npm run lint`, `npm run format`) so code style stays consistent.
6. **Document your PR**: Describe the scope, motivation, and test results in the Pull Request to help reviewers understand the change quickly.

Issues and PRs are always welcome. Thanks for contributing!
